    <p>Hello everyone, what a pleasure to share this course with you.
    I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Technology. 
    It's really something new for me, since I am an accounting analyst
    and I almost always said that technology and programming is not for me. 
    But the job market is full of opportunities in this field, so that encourages me</p>
    <p>A little bit is that I really enjoy being at home, reading and sometimes watching
    movies or National Geographic series. I think my life is very normal, 
    I have a full-time job and weekends off. My job consumes a lot of my time, 
    because it is accounting, so I use the time I have free to rest or spend time reading
    and watching series. I also really enjoy riding a motorcycle, so I do it often to get
    to know a little about my country. A few months ago I went to El Salvador and I really enjoyed the trip.</p>
    <p>I am grateful for all the opportunities and blessings of heavenly father in my life.
    And I am sure that this technology opportunity is one of them. I have been a member of 
    the church for 7 years, in fact I will celebrate tomorrow. 
    I feel very grateful to belong to the church, I fulfilled a mission in Costa Rica 
    and it is a great happiness for me.</p>
